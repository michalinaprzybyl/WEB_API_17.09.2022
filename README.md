# WEB_API_17.09.2022

I created this repository while learning the WEB API. I cleared the visible HTML page by element.remove() and then rebuilt it using document.createElement(), etc. I also created Page 1 and Page 2, an additional two sub-pages, using export/import. Page 1 contains a form field and Page 2 contains a calculator. Page 3 was left untouched. The file "ex1.js" was used to learn how to invoke the relevant page elements and refer to them.
